## Assignment 9: Brief Report

### Results Summary
- Successfully developed and implemented feature engineering techniques, including age categorization, income ratio features, and work-life indicators.
- Achieved robust data preprocessing, validation, and visualization for exploratory data analysis.
- Built and evaluated predictive models using scikit-learn, resulting in satisfactory performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).
- Generated clear visualizations to interpret feature distributions and model results.

### Challenges Faced
- **Data Quality Issues:** Encountered missing values and inconsistent data formats, requiring careful cleaning and validation.
- **Feature Selection:** Identifying the most relevant features for the predictive model was non-trivial due to multicollinearity and high dimensionality.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Maintaining interpretability while applying label and one-hot encoding presented complexity.
- **PDF Export:** Faced issues with Jupyter notebook to PDF conversion due to missing LaTeX dependencies.

### Solutions Implemented
- Applied systematic data cleaning and validation checks to ensure dataset integrity.
- Used correlation analysis and feature importance evaluation to guide feature selection.
- Developed custom feature engineering functions for enhanced model input.
- Implemented encoding strategies that balanced model performance and interpretability.
- Provided alternative notebook export options (HTML to PDF) when LaTeX was unavailable.
